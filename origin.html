        So nobody really knows how this story really came about.  Herodotus wrote about how 
        there were some trees in india that kinda seemed sheepy or something, but tbh that story
        doesn't really add up so idk if I buy that.  Theres been some folk lore tales of some kinda
        legendary plant animal, and some people say thats more likely? But like who knows really.

        Either way, this story is basically dead nowadays, but a lot of historians are interested
        in just trying to figure out exactly how this story came about.  So it gained a lot of traction
        in recent history because of that.  It's an interesting idea for sure.
