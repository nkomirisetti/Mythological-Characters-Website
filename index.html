        Da Vegetable Lamb of Tartary be a legendary zoophyte of Central Asia,
        once believed ta grow sheep as its fruit. Dat shiznit was believed tha
        sheep was connected ta tha plant by a umbilical cord n' grazed tha land
        round tha plant. When all accessible foliage was gone, both tha plant
        n' sheep died.
        Underlyin tha legend is tha cotton plant which was unknown up in Uptown

        This myth is insane, so basically what happens is this lamb is grown from a plant, but
        like its attached to the plant right? So basically the plant stalk is like a leash for it,
        like it can only walk around as far as the plant stalk can let it. Once it eats all the grass
        around it, dude literally just has to die. Like thats it.
