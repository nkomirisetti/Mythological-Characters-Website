        So basically there are lots of version of this story, and for some reason the way 
        they are born is always different.  One of the most popular reasons for the way they
        are born is actually via a special seed.  The way this seed works is that people sometimes
        just drop it and it sprouts on its own.

        The thing basically starts sprouting until it becomes big enough to kinda walk around the plant and
        start eating grass around the area.  It gets bigger by eating this grass, and this kinda contributes 
        to the growth of the plant as well.
